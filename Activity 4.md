#### Annotations
- **B-GAP is a training model for autonomous driving** 
	- <span style="color:skyblue;font-weight:900;">Why?</span>
		- Current autonomous driving systems are usually applicable to highway traffic situations
		- B-GAP can be applicable for complex urban environments
			- like those of Asian cities, where people are less likely to follow the rules 
	* <span style="color:skyblue;font-weight:bold;">How?</span>
		* using artifical intelligence
